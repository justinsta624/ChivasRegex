# ChivasRegex: Tutorial on Matching a URL

Regular expressions, commonly referred to as Regex, constitute a highly valuable and potent tool for extracting information from textual sources, encompassing code, log files, spreadsheets, and documents. Among the myriad applications, a prevalent use case involves the validation and matching of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).

This tutorial will provide comprehensive guidance on employing Regex to ascertain the adherence of a given string to the standardized URL format.

## Summary

Within this document, I will elucidate the utilization of a regular expression designed to validate URLs, guaranteeing adherence to a specific pattern:

```regex
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/
```

While the sequence of characters may appear cryptic at first glance, it represents a structured assembly of regular expression components, each of which will be thoroughly explored in the subsequent discussion.

Let us delve into the intricacies of each Regex Component, elucidating the process of constructing a robust URL matching pattern using the content provided in this document.
